<!-- Where it began -->

<section id="beginning">
  <h3>The COVID-19 pandemic that began in early 2020 was the trigger of the rise in AAPI hate crimes. Misinformation and fear spread like wildfire all over the media and news, resulting in many blaming Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders for the cause of the pandemic. The consequential paranoia and anxiety then spiraled into a trend of discrimination toward AAPI individuals, with verbal and physical attacks becoming a more frequent practice.</h3>
